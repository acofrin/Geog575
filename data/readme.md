# This folder holds data files used to create your thematic web maps, and thus is not necessary for all website.  The data folder can hold CSV, GeoJSON, and other formats that we will cover later. You also might wish to keep original Esri Shapefiles in it; these should go in a shapefiles subdirectory within the data folder, since a shapefile in itself is technically a file directory just like a website.
